# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

This is a repository where I learn to use Go while refreshing my memory in data structures and algorithms

I basically created a console application to use the different topics I learnt in the past

## How to use it

Prerequisite: you need to have Go installed on your computer, that's all

Clone the repository, modify the Go version in go.mod if necessary

If you want to run the demo program, run this:
```
cd demo
go run demo.go
```

If you want to run the console app, run this:
```
go run main.go
```

The instructions are available if you type "--help" in all the modes, they are also shown whenever you start the console or switch modes
